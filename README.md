A monolitic nodejs-ejs-mysql framework model for free lancers.
This model is indicated for free lancers who need to deliver a small system.

# How to install dependencies
Run: npm install

# Setting up database
Import the database model named as config/backup.sql
Name the database as you wish, I like using 'companyShortcut_applicationShortcut_db' example 'hls_pdv_db'.
After doing this just go to /config/passport and /app/model to set the new database on functions.
